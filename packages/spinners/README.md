# `@truffle/spinners`

This is used to manage multiple CLI spinners. It is essentially just a wrapper
around the [`spinnies`](https://github.com/jcarpanelli/spinnies) library that
keeps a single instance of the `spinnies` object in module-level scope.

For more details on usage, see the docs for the `Spinnies` class in the
`spinnies` module.
